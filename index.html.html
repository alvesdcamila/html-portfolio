I have expertise in generating and interpreting operational reports, managing key performance indicators, and creating efficient workflows. Currently, I am expanding my skills through a programming course, focused on system development and supporting analytical processes. Driven by clear goals, I work to deliver results with a high impact and strategic alignment to organisational needs.
